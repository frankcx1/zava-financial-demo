# Field Inspection Copilot — On-Device AI Workflow

## Overview

The Field Inspection tab is a seven-milestone feature inside the NPU Demo Flask application that demonstrates a complete field inspection workflow — from voice capture through final report — running entirely on-device with zero cloud dependencies. Every AI task executes on the local NPU at ~5W sustained power draw. The feature was built for live demo at MWC Barcelona (March 2-5, 2026) on Intel Core Ultra (Lunar Lake) hardware.

The workspace is a four-panel CSS Grid layout: a form panel (left), photo/camera panel (center), findings log and report panel (right), and a status bar (bottom) tracking cumulative token usage and cost ($0.00 throughout).

Three on-device AI systems collaborate across the workflow:

| AI System | Type | Role |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Windows Fluid Dictation** | System service (Win+H) | Speech-to-text on NPU |
| **Phi-4 Mini** (3.8B params) | SLM via Foundry Local | Text: field extraction, report gen, translation |
| **Phi Silica** | On-device vision model | Image: classification, description, handwriting extraction |

---

## Step 1: Voice Capture via Fluid Dictation

**The problem:** An inspector arrives on-site and needs to log basic details — who they are, where they are, what was reported, and when. Typing on a tablet in the field is slow and awkward.

**The solution:** Windows Fluid Dictation (Win+H), a system-level voice typing service that runs on-device via the NPU. The app programmatically triggers it by sending a `Win+H` keystroke through PowerShell's `keybd_event` P/Invoke via the `/inspection/fluid-dictation` endpoint. This opens the Windows Voice Typing overlay, which transcribes speech directly into the app's textarea in real time — no microphone API wrangling, no audio blob uploads, no third-party speech model.

The inspector speaks naturally:

> *"Inspector Sarah Chen at Building C, second floor, north corridor. Date March 3rd, 2026 at 10:15 AM. Reported issue: water staining on ceiling tiles near the elevator bank. Source: property manager report from last Friday."*

The transcript populates in the textarea as they speak. When done, a "Scripted Input" fallback button is available for demo reliability — it pre-fills a canned transcript so the demo never stalls on ambient noise or mic issues.

**AI component:** Windows Fluid Dictation — system-level NPU-accelerated speech-to-text. No application code needed for the transcription itself; the app just opens and closes the system overlay.

---

## Step 2: Phi-4 Mini Field Extraction (Voice to Structured Form)

**The problem:** The transcript is free-form spoken text. The inspection form needs discrete structured fields.

**The solution:** The "Extract Fields" button sends the raw transcript to `POST /inspection/transcribe`, which passes it to **Phi-4 Mini** running on the NPU via Foundry Local. The system prompt constrains the model to a strict JSON schema:

```json
{
  "inspector_name": "Sarah Chen",
  "location": "Building C, 2nd Floor, North Corridor",
  "datetime": "2026-03-03T10:15:00",
  "reported_issue": "Water Staining",
  "source": "Property Manager Report"
}
```

The model parses natural language into structured data — "Building C, second floor, north corridor" becomes the `location` field, "March 3rd, 2026 at 10:15 AM" becomes an ISO datetime, etc.

On the frontend, the extracted fields animate into the form sequentially with a 200ms stagger — each field fading in one by one with a green highlight. This is the "it understood me" moment: the inspector spoke freely and the form filled itself without a single keystroke.

**AI component:** Phi-4 Mini on NPU via Foundry Local — constrained JSON extraction from natural language. ~300 tokens, 5-10 seconds.

---

## Step 3: Camera Capture + Photo Classification

**The problem:** The inspector needs to photograph the issue and get an immediate AI assessment of what they're looking at.

**The solution:** The center panel provides a live camera preview via `getUserMedia()` with front/rear camera toggle. The inspector captures a photo (or cycles through five demo preset photos for reliability: water damage, structural crack, mold, electrical hazard, trip hazard).

Classification follows a **three-tier fallback architecture**:

### Tier 1: Phi Silica Vision (Preferred Path)

The captured image is sent to `POST /inspection/classify`, which forwards it to a **custom C# microservice** running on `localhost:5100`. This service wraps **Phi Silica** — Microsoft's on-device vision model available through the Windows App SDK 1.8.

#### Why a Separate MSIX Service?

Phi Silica is a Windows API, not a standard REST model. Accessing it requires:

1. **A packaged MSIX application** with the `systemAIModels` restricted capability declared in its manifest. Unpackaged apps cannot access Phi Silica.

2. **A LAF (Limited Access Feature) token** — a cryptographic attestation issued by Microsoft that authorizes a specific Package Family Name (PFN) to use the `com.microsoft.windows.ai.languagemodel` feature. The token is tied to the app's PFN (`Microsoft.NPUDemo.VisionService_r0xr04974zwaa`) and must be unlocked at runtime via `Windows.ApplicationModel.LimitedAccessFeatures.TryUnlockFeature()`.

3. **Windows App SDK 1.8** with the `Microsoft.Windows.AI.Imaging` namespace, which provides `ImageDescriptionGenerator` — the API that sends images to the on-device Phi Silica model.

The vision service (C# ASP.NET Core 8.0) converts uploaded JPEG bytes into a `SoftwareBitmap`, wraps it in an `ImageBuffer.CreateForSoftwareBitmap()`, and calls `_generator.DescribeAsync()` with `DetailedDescription` kind. The raw description is then mapped to constrained inspection categories via a keyword-scoring algorithm — each category has a curated keyword list, and the highest-scoring category wins. Confidence is derived from match strength and severity maps from category + confidence (e.g., Electrical Hazard at >=70% confidence maps to Critical).

See [Vision Service Architecture](#vision-service-architecture) below for full technical details.

### Tier 2: Phi-4 Mini Text Fallback

If the Vision Service is unavailable (not running, LAF token issue, etc.), the Flask backend falls back to Phi-4 Mini with filename hints. The model receives textual context about the image and generates a classification from that. Less accurate than actual vision, but keeps the demo flowing.

### Tier 3: Hardcoded Demo Presets

If both AI paths fail, hardcoded classifications return immediately with realistic confidence values:

| Demo Photo | Category | Severity | Confidence |
|-----------|----------|----------|------------|
| water_damage | Water Damage | Moderate | 82% |
| structural_crack | Structural Crack | High | 72% |
| mold | Mold | High | 88% |
| electrical_hazard | Electrical Hazard | Critical | 91% |
| trip_hazard | Trip Hazard | Low | 85% |

**The result** is a classification card showing category (color-coded), severity badge (Low/Moderate/High/Critical), a confidence bar (green >=75%, amber 60-74%, red <60%), a one-line explanation, and the analysis source. The finding is stored for report generation. Confidence values in the amber zone (60-74%) trigger the escalation dialog in Step 7.

**AI components:** Phi Silica Vision on NPU (via MSIX + LAF token) with Phi-4 Mini text fallback. ~1.5 seconds for demo presets, variable for live classification.

---

## Step 4: Pen Annotation + Handwriting Extraction

**The problem:** The inspector wants to circle a problem area, draw an arrow, and scribble a note directly on the photo — the way they'd mark up a paper printout.

**The solution:** Tapping the annotate button on any photo thumbnail opens a full-screen lightbox with two stacked canvas layers: a base canvas (the photo) and a transparent ink canvas on top. The Pointer Events API captures pen, touch, and mouse input — including Surface Pen with pressure sensitivity. Strokes render in red (#ef4444) at 7px width for visibility. A toolbar provides Undo, Clear, Done, and Cancel actions.

When the inspector taps **Done**:

1. Both canvases are composited into a single JPEG (photo + ink overlay baked together)
2. The composite is sent to `POST /inspection/annotate`
3. **Tier 1 (Phi Silica):** The endpoint forwards the image to the Vision Service's `/describe` endpoint, which uses Phi Silica to generate a detailed description of the annotated photo. That description is then post-processed by Phi-4 Mini to extract any handwritten text mentions from the vision output.
4. **Tier 2 (Phi-4 Mini text):** If the Vision Service is down, Phi-4 Mini generates a plausible inspector note based on the finding context (e.g., "Moisture detected around window frame").
5. **Tier 3 (Hardcoded):** Fallback returns "Check pipe above - possible leak source."

The extracted text is stored in the finding's annotations, displayed as an "Inspector Note" in the findings log, and rendered as a blockquote in the final report. The thumbnail updates to show the annotated version with a red pen badge.

**AI components:** Phi Silica Vision (image description) + Phi-4 Mini (text extraction from description). Two-model pipeline for handwriting extraction.

---

## Step 5: Report Generation

**The problem:** All the data has been collected — voice transcript, structured fields, photo classifications, pen annotations. It needs to become a professional inspection report.

**The solution:** The "Generate Report" button (active once at least one finding exists) sends all collected data to `POST /inspection/report`. Photo base64 data is stripped to stay within the ~4K token context window.

**Phi-4 Mini** generates a complete HTML report with:
- **Header block** — inspector name, location, date, reported issue
- **Executive summary** — 2-3 sentence overview
- **Finding details** — each finding with severity badge, confidence, explanation, and inspector notes rendered as blockquotes
- **Overall risk rating** — Low / Moderate / High / Critical (derived from findings)
- **Recommended next steps** — 2-4 actionable bullets

The report renders in the right panel as a styled HTML document. A "Regenerate Report" button allows iteration. If the model fails, a hardcoded fallback generates a basic report from the raw findings data — the demo never dead-ends.

**AI component:** Phi-4 Mini on NPU — report synthesis from structured + unstructured inputs. Temperature 0.3 for consistency. ~500 tokens, 10-20 seconds.

---

## Step 6: Translation

**The problem:** Inspection teams work across language boundaries. A report generated in English needs to be immediately available in Spanish for local contractors or regulatory bodies.

**The solution:** After report generation, a "Translate to Spanish" button appears. Clicking it sends the report HTML to `POST /inspection/translate`, where **Phi-4 Mini** translates the complete document while preserving HTML structure, section organization, and professional construction/inspection terminology.

The UI plays a brief 500ms side-by-side animation (EN | ES split) before settling on the Spanish version. The button toggles to "Switch to English" for instant back-and-forth — no re-inference needed for the cached version. A status message confirms: "no cloud API call."

If translation fails, the original report is wrapped with a Spanish header: *"Traduccion automatica no disponible."*

**AI component:** Phi-4 Mini on NPU — document translation with structure preservation. ~450 tokens, 10-20 seconds.

---

## Step 7: Escalation Router + Dashboard Tally

### Escalation Decision

**The trigger:** Any finding with confidence between 60-74% (the amber zone) automatically triggers an escalation dialog. The structural crack demo photo at 72% confidence is purpose-built to demonstrate this.

A modal presents two side-by-side options:

| Escalate to Cloud | Keep Local (Recommended) |
|---|---|
| Send photo to a frontier vision model | Proceed with local classification |
| Payload: 1 photo (XXX KB) | Data leaving device: **None** |
| Withheld: transcript, annotations, report | Cost: **$0.00** |
| Requires connectivity | Flag for manual expert review |

**"Keep Local"** (the demo path): A lock animation plays, a banner confirms "Inspection completed locally," and the finding is flagged for on-site expert review. The "Show Summary" button appears.

**"Escalate to Cloud"**: In airplane mode (the demo scenario), this gracefully fails with "No connectivity - keeping data local" and falls back to the same local path. This is deliberate — it demonstrates offline resilience.

### Dashboard Tally

The final screen is a full-overlay summary showing every AI task completed during the inspection:

```
+----------------------------+----------------------------+
|   LOCAL AI TASKS           |   CLOUD TASKS              |
|   [check] Speech-to-text   |                            |
|   [check] Field extraction  |         0                  |
|   [check] Vision classif.  |                            |
|   [check] Pen annotation   |                            |
|   [check] Report generation|                            |
|   [check] Translation      |                            |
|   [check] Routing logic    |                            |
+----------------------------+----------------------------+
| Total tokens: ~520 | Cost: $0.00 | Data transmitted: 0B |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
```

This is the closing visual — photographable from 15 feet away at a trade show — that makes the point: seven distinct AI tasks, two different on-device models, zero cloud calls, zero cost, zero data egress.

## Vision Service Architecture

The Phi Silica Vision Service is a standalone C# ASP.NET Core 8.0 microservice, packaged as an MSIX and running on `localhost:5100`.

### Why MSIX Packaging Is Required

Phi Silica is accessed through the Windows App SDK's `Microsoft.Windows.AI.Imaging` namespace. This API has two hard requirements:

1. **`systemAIModels` capability** — declared in `Package.appxmanifest`. Only MSIX-packaged apps can declare restricted capabilities.
2. **LAF (Limited Access Feature) token** — a signed attestation from Microsoft granting a specific PFN access to `com.microsoft.windows.ai.languagemodel`. Without this, the API calls may fail on retail Windows builds (works without it on Windows Insider dev channel).

### Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/health` | GET | Returns service status + Phi Silica availability |
| `/classify` | POST | Image classification for inspection findings |
| `/describe` | POST | General image description (used for annotation text extraction) |
| `/extract-text` | POST | Handwritten text extraction from annotated photos |

### Key Namespaces

```csharp
using Microsoft.Graphics.Imaging;           // ImageBuffer
using Microsoft.Windows.AI.Imaging;         // ImageDescriptionGenerator
using Microsoft.Windows.AI.ContentSafety;   // ContentFilterOptions
using Windows.Graphics.Imaging;             // SoftwareBitmap, BitmapDecoder
```

### Image Processing Pipeline

1. Raw bytes from POST upload -> `InMemoryRandomAccessStream`
2. `BitmapDecoder` decodes JPEG/PNG
3. Convert to `SoftwareBitmap` with `Bgra8` pixel format
4. Wrap in `ImageBuffer.CreateForSoftwareBitmap()`
5. `_generator.DescribeAsync(imageBuffer, descKind, contentFilterOptions)`
6. Map free-text description to constrained category via keyword scoring

### Classification Algorithm

The `MapToInspectionCategory()` method scores Phi Silica's free-text description against keyword lists for each category:

- **Water Damage:** water, moisture, leak, stain, discoloration, puddle, seepage
- **Structural Crack:** crack, fracture, settlement, foundation, wall, fissure
- **Mold:** mold, fungus, spore, mildew, growth, organic
- **Electrical Hazard:** wire, outlet, spark, panel, exposed, burn, voltage
- **Trip Hazard:** trip, uneven, raised, loose, threshold, floor, gap

The highest-scoring category wins. Confidence scales from match strength (score >=5 maps to 70-95%, score >=3 maps to 65-80%). Severity is derived from category + confidence.

### Build and Deploy

The MSIX is built, signed, and installed via `vision-service/scripts/rebuild-msix.ps1`:

1. `dotnet publish -c Release` with MSIX generation
2. Sign with self-signed cert `CN=FrankBu` (thumbprint: `D105059461CAEB607A40723E92CBDFB91917A570`)
3. Install Windows App Runtime 1.8 dependency
4. Install the signed MSIX package

The cert must be trusted on the target machine (imported to `Cert:\LocalMachine\TrustedPeople`) before the MSIX will install.

### Pre-Built Package

A pre-built MSIX is included in the repo at `vision-service/AppPackages/` for quick deployment to new devices without rebuilding from source. The `setup.ps1` script handles installation automatically.

---

## New Device Setup

To transfer the complete demo to a new Copilot+ PC, run the unified setup script:

```powershell
.\setup.ps1
```

This handles:
1. Python 3.11 installation (winget, auto-detects x64 vs ARM64)
2. Foundry Local installation (`winget install Microsoft.FoundryLocal`)
3. Python dependencies (Flask, OpenAI SDK, foundry-local-sdk)
4. Demo data verification
5. Foundry Local SDK validation
6. Model availability check (Phi-4 Mini ~3GB download on first run)
7. Vision Service certificate trust + MSIX installation

### Prerequisites for Vision Service

- **Windows 11** with Copilot+ PC features (NPU required)
- **Windows App SDK 1.8** runtime (installed automatically with MSIX)
- The Phi Silica on-device AI model must be available (controlled by Windows Settings > Privacy & Security > AI models)
- On retail Windows builds, the LAF token must match the MSIX signing certificate's PFN

### Known Constraints

| Constraint | Impact | Workaround |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| LAF token is PFN-locked | Different signing cert = different PFN = token invalid | Use provided cert, or works without token on Insider dev channel |
| Phi Silica model download | System-managed, not bundled | Ensure Windows AI models are enabled in Settings |
| Self-signed cert trust | Requires admin on target machine | `setup.ps1` handles this with elevation prompt |

## Architecture Summary

| Layer | Technology | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **Frontend** | Vanilla JS IIFEs, Canvas API, Pointer Events, getUserMedia | UI, camera, pen input |
| **Flask Backend** | Python on localhost:5000 | Orchestration, Phi-4 Mini inference via Foundry Local |
| **Foundry Local** | Microsoft runtime (dynamic port) | Hosts Phi-4 Mini on Intel NPU (~5W) |
| **Vision Service** | C# ASP.NET Core MSIX on localhost:5100 | Wraps Phi Silica via Windows App SDK 1.8 |
| **Phi-4 Mini** | 3.8B parameter SLM | Text: field extraction, report gen, translation |
| **Phi Silica** | On-device vision model (Windows AI) | Image: classification, description, text extraction |
| **Fluid Dictation** | Windows system service (Win+H) | Speech-to-text on NPU |

Every component runs on `127.0.0.1`. The three-tier fallback pattern (preferred AI path -> alternate AI path -> hardcoded safe default) ensures the demo never fails, even if individual services are unavailable. The entire workflow completes in airplane mode with zero network calls.
